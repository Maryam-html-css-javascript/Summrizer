To run the Text Summarizer GUI application, you'll need to install the following libraries:

1. **Tkinter**: Tkinter is Python's de facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a wrapper around Tcl/Tk, a simple, cross-platform toolkit for creating GUIs.

   You can install Tkinter using the following command:
   ```
   pip install tk
   ```

2. **Sumy**: Sumy is a Python library for automatic text summarization. It provides implementations of several popular summarization algorithms.

   You can install Sumy using the following command:
   ```
   pip install sumy
   ```

3. **NLTK**: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources, such as WordNet.

   You can install NLTK using the following command:
   ```
   pip install nltk
   ```

   Additionally, you need to download the NLTK data required for tokenization:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

4. **Requests**: Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings. It allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily.

   You can install Requests using the following command:
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```

Once you have installed these libraries, you should be able to run the Text Summarizer GUI application without any issues. If you encounter any errors related to missing libraries, you can refer back to this list and ensure that all required libraries are installed.
